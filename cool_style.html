    <p>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Oh, ow! And the hat. She's a witch! Shut up! Shut up!</p>
    <p>On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. <strong> Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</strong> <em> Where'd you get the coconuts?</em> How do you know she is a witch?</p>

    <p>Bloody Peasant! You don't vote for kings. I'm not a witch. Well, what do you want? Why?</p>

    <p>She looks like one. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! Why? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</p>

    <p>What a strange person. Now, look here, my good man. We found them. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
